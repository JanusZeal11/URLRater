# URLRater
This was a coding challenge for a company I applied for.

It takes a list of URLs from the related URLGenerator project and opens an single page application where the user can vote for their favorites.  No saving of votes were required.  The XML result file needs to be inserted into the Data folder to get a new list of URLs to vote on.
